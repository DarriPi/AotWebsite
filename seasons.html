				<p>
					As the tragic final season of Attack on Titan approaches,
					just briefly recapping each season's story would be a wonderful way to relive the amazing anime series.

					<p>	
						The season where it all began.
						Season 1 of Attack on Titan has arguably one of the best openings of any anime. 
						Here we just get thrown into what the world of Attack on Titan really is like and how dangerous the titans are.
					</p>
					<p>
						To explain the story in short: We get introduced to the main characters. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackermann, and Armin Arlert We get to see how peaceful life is within the walls and see brief instances of the titans outside. 
						All of this peace gets ruined when, all of a sudden, a giant collosal titan appears out of thin air. This Titan is over 50 meters tall, tall enough to look at the walls of Shiganshina.
						The Titan then proceeds to kick open the main door, allowing dozens of titans to enter and devour the humans within.
						Eren loses his mom in the process and vows to kill every titan on Earth, and so the story of Attack on Titan begins.
					</p>
					<p>
						This season has 25 episodes in total and the pilot episode is called <q>To You, in 2000 Years: The Fall of Shiganshina, Part 1</q>.
						and was released on 7 April 2013

					</p>
					<p>
						This season is where humanity starts to dive deeper into the Titans. 
						After the ending of season 1 and discovering that titans actually live inside the walls,
						humans inside the walls do more research and seek to understand more.
					</p>
					<p>
						This season, we discover more about the Titans and where they actually come from.
						We also get introduced to a new intelligent titan called the Beast Titan, who can tell other titans what to do.
						This is the first time we have ever seen a titan talk. We also see another new Titan this season. The Jaw Titan. 
						This titan was in the possession of Ymir, who is in love with Historia. 
						We also find out a lot about Historia and her heritage. We discover that, in fact, she is part of the royal family.
						Her identity continues to become a central focus of the season.
						But the real highlight of the show is when the people behind the Armored Titan and the Collosal Titan get revealed.
						This is the season where the Armoured and Collosal titans get revealed, which is easily one of the biggest twists in anime history.
						This reveal changed Eren because it was his two best friends, Reiner and Bertholdt. This season is one of the best seasons in Attack on Titan.
						It ends by letting us know more about the nature of the titans and the walls.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was all done in only 12 episodes, and the first episode was called <q>Beast Titan</q> and first
						aired on 1 April 2017.

					</p>
					<p>
						In this season we learn more about the complex world. This season
						is really packed and has in fact two parts to it.
					</p>
					<h3>Part 1</h3>
					<p>
						The season begins with a government conspiracy. 
						This conspiracy led to the Reiss family, who covered up the secrets of the Titans for a while. 
						This is also how we get introduced to a new antogonist. Kenny, the reaper, who is actually a distant relative of Levi Ackerman.
						He is a strong warrior and a former member of the military police. 
						He was supposed to kidnap Eren Yeager to give him over to Rod Reis, Historia's father. 
						We get to learn here even more about Historia's past and where she comes from.
						We also get shown where the founding got passed down for generations in the history of Attack on Titan.
					</p>
					<h3>Part 2</h3>
					<p>
						In Part 2 of this season, the scouts go on an expedition outside the walls to go to Eren Yeager's lost home.
						We go back to Shiganshina to find hidden information his father had kept away for years about the truth about what is actually outside the walls.
						But they find the warriors, Reiner, Bertholdt, and Zeke, there waiting for them. 
						It leads to an epic battle for Shiganshina, and a lot of lives are lost in the process.
						But in the end, we find out what lies outside the walls. What lies outside are other humans. Humans that hate Eldians and want to exterminate them from the Earth.
						They are the ones who sent all the pure Titans to Eldia. And this is how the war in Season 4 really began.
					</p>
					<p>
						This season of Attack on Titan has 22 episodes in total and is divided into two parts. It got first broadcast on July 23, 2018 and the 
						first episode was called "Smoke Signal".

						<img src="images/Seasons/Season_4.jpeg" width="185px" height="256px" alt="Season 4 Poster">
					</p>
					<p>
						This season is a massive shift in the story line.
						If you started the anime in season 4, you would not even know that it was Attack on Titan.
					<p>
						We begin off by learning more about Marley and how they live compared to Eldia. 
						Keep in mind that they are the ones that sent the Warriors to Eldia.
						We also get introduced to new characters such as Gabi, Falco, and Zeke, Eren's half brother. All these characters let us see the story from a whole new perspective,
						not just from Eldia's viewpoint anymore. 
						We find out why Marley hates Eldia so much and why they went to the island in the first place. This season, we explore various themes, such as discrimination and racism. We also explore what war can do to the human mind. To summarise this season.
						It is packed with action, and Marley and Eldia are officially at war here. Eren is a changed man and will do anything to win the war and kill all his enemies.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The final season consists of 29 episodes and first aired on December 7, 2020. The first episode was called "The Other Side of the Sea."
