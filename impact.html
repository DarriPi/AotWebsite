				<h1>The Impact of Attack on Titan</h1>
				<h3>Animation</h3>
				<p>
					Over the years, a lot of animated movies and shows were released, but only a few of them really changed the game in terms of animation. 
					Attack on Titan is one of them. The series has stunning scenes with smooth animation. 
					It sets the stacks high in the anime industry because of its amazing animation.
					<br><br>
					There is this one scene in particular that stands out in Season 3, Episode 3,
					where Levi Ackerman has to fight Kenny Ackerman and the military police. 
					This scene has one of the best animations in anime history.
					They made stunning use of the camera angle while still allowing the user to know what was going on. 
					This scene alone sets the bar high for animation.
				</p>
				<h3>Community Impact</h3>
				<p>
					Attack on Titan was not just a popular anime in Japan but globally as well. 
					In fact, it became so popular that it opened the door up for other anime's to go mainstream. 
					The anime also got games, subseries, and movies made about it.
					<br><br>
					There is also a dedicated fanbase that cosplays a lot of the titans and characters. 
					The anime had such a big impact on social media as well that for a month my feed was only about people pointing at the sea, 
					which is a reference to the ending of Season 3 where Eren points out to the sea.
					<br><br>
					To summarise the massive impact Attack on Titan had on the anime industry, 
					It had gotten a lot of people hooked on anime and animation in general. 
					It inspired a lot of anime today, as well as how they tell their stories.
					I honestly cannot wait to see what comes out next!
