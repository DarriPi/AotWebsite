				<h1>Welcome to the world of Titans!</h1>
				<p>
					Welcome to the World of Titans! Whether you are already a big anime fan or just someone who wishes to get into anime, I've got the perfect anime for you!!
				</p>
				<h2>What is Attack On Titan</h2>
				<p>
					Attack on Titan is a Japanese anime series created by the manga writer Hajime Isayama. 
					The show was first animated by Wit Studio, but Mappa took over in Season 4 of the anime.
					The creator of the Attack on Titan series and manga writer, Hajime Isayama, got the idea for the manga series from his childhood.
					He stated in an interview that he thought of the series from an old video game about aliens invading Earth. 
					This is where he got the idea of giant Titans invading humanity. 
					The series continued to get animated and is considered today as one of the best anime series ever created, having won multiple awards in its lifetime! 
					So I am excited to show you more about it on my little website!
				</p>
				<h2>Why get into Attack on Titan or Anime in general?</h2>
				<p>
					Anime is an entertainment medium that has a little something for everyone. 
					Whether you are into emotional story-telling series and movies or just comedy, Anime has it for you! But what distinguishes anime? 
					Is the freedom of the brush. 
					Anime and animation in general can tell stories like no other entertainment medium in the world.Â 
					It can make a scene that is almost impossible to make in real life. 
					If you have watched Death Note, then you know what I mean. But why would I make a webpage for Attack on Titan, then?
					Well my friend. To put it simply, Attack on Titan is simply one of the best anime in the world. 
					It has animation like no other, a captivating story and amazing characters.
					If you are new to anime or looking for your next anime to watch, Attack on Titan the one for you!
